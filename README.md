# heart-diesease-prediction-app
CardioCare is a project that aims to develop a heart disease prediction system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system will use patient data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other relevant factors to predict the likelihood of heart disease
Further Deployed the ML model using streamlit platform
